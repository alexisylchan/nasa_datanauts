      "The 2005 Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) is a measure of overall progress towards environmental sustainability, developed for 146 countries. The index provides a composite profile of national environmental stewardship based on a compilation of 21 indicators derived from 76 underlying datasets. The 2005 version of the ESI represents a significant update and improvement on earlier versions; the country ESI scores or rankings should not be compared to earlier versions because of changes to the methodology and underlying data. The index was unveiled at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, January 2005, Davos, Switzerland. The 2005 ESI is a joint product of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP) and the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), in collaboration with the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), European Commission.\n",

      "The High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) Level 3AT data product consists of daily, 65.536 second interval time-ordered vertical profiles of meridional and zonal wind components, temperature and volume emmission rate of O2.  The instrument measured Doppler shifts of spectral lines in the visible and near-IR between 400 and 800 nm.  HRDI was flown on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and designed to measure winds and other parameters in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by primarily observing the Doppler shift of emitted light, and in the stratosphere by observing the Doppler shift of atmospheric absorption features. Measurements were made in the mesosphere between 50 and 115 km, and in the stratosphere between 10 and 40 km at about 2.5 km resolution. Data were collected between latitude 40S and 76N and 76S and 40N, alternating each satellite yaw cycle of about 36 days. The HRDI Level 3AT data were processed with the version 11 algorithm.\n",

      "Long-lived Venus landers require power and cooling. Heat from the roughly 64 General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) modules must be delivered to the convertor with minimal DT. The cooling system must be shutoff during the transit to Venus without overheating the GPHS modules. This program will develop an alkali metal Variable Conductance Heat Pipe (VCHP) integrated with a two-phase heat collection/transport package (HTP) between the GPHS stack and the convertor.  The VCHP allows the Stirling converter to be shutoff during transit to Venus. The two-phase HTP minimizes the temperature drop between the multi-GPHS stack and the heater head.  The HTP is required due to the large number of modules that must be interfaced, and the low allowable DT between the heater head temperature of 1200&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C and the maximum allowable iridium cladding temperature in the GPHS (1266&lt;SUP&gt;o&lt;/SUP&gt;C). The HTP also improves the convertor efficiency by decreasing the temperature non-uniformities at the high heat flux interface of the hot end of the heater head.  It is superior to pumped liquid systems for transferring heat, because it eliminates the low efficiency liquid metal pump that they require.  Other advantages of the system include low mass and volume, and a high degree of redundancy. \n",
